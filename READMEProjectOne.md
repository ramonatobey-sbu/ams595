To use my code for project one, part A is not customizable to get the result, just run it and you will see the graphs generated.
For part B, the user can change the inital value of the sigFig variable to determine how many significant figures of pi they want to generate. 
For part C, the user can input a value to my function piSpec() to specify the number of significant figures, mine starts off with four.
